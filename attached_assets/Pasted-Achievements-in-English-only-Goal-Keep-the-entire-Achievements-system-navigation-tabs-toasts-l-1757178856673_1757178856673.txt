Achievements in English only

Goal:
Keep the entire Achievements system (navigation, tabs, toasts, labels, actions) in English only, regardless of the rest of the app language (which may stay RTL Hebrew).

1) Navigation

Sidebar: show “Achievements” (with trophy icon).

Top bar: also add link “Achievements”.

Route: /achievements.

Do not localize this label; always show in English.

2) Tabs (English only)

Overview

Missions

Badges

Leaderboard

History

3) Text & Labels

All text inside Achievements pages must be in English only, e.g.:

“My Balance”, “Unlocked Badges”, “In Progress”, “Daily Check-in”.

Mission titles/descriptions come from DB (achievements.description), show them as English strings only (no Hebrew fallback).

Badge metadata: name, description, rarity, tier → always in English.

4) Toasts & Messages

Success toast: "Points added successfully"

Error toast: "Error awarding points, please try again"

Achievement unlocked: "🏆 New badge unlocked: {{name}} (+{{points}} pts)"

Daily check-in duplicate: "Already checked in today"

Auth required: "Sign in with Google to save your progress"

5) UX Notes

Even if the rest of the app uses RTL/Hebrew, Achievements section must stay LTR English:

Force dir="ltr" for the Achievements root container.

Text alignment: left.

Numbers and dates: use English/US locale formatting (MM/DD/YYYY, thousands separators).

6) Data Binding

All queries remain the same:

user_points_summary → balance & level

user_achievements joined with achievements → unlocked + in-progress

achievements → catalog

points_ledger → history

v_leaderboard_30d or aggregate from points_ledger → leaderboard

Display as-is, assuming English strings in DB.

7) Testing

Sidebar + topbar always show “Achievements”.

Tabs always in English.

Toasts/messages only in English.

Page renders LTR layout even if app is RTL elsewhere.

If DB contains Hebrew text in achievements, still render them, but do not provide Hebrew labels/tooltips from the UI side.

⚠️ Important:
Do not add Hebrew translations or RTL styling inside the Achievements pages. The rest of the app may stay in Hebrew/RTL, but Achievements is English-only, LTR.
